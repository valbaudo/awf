// fiveStepSeqWorkflow uses `retry: { attempts: 1 }` on every step — see
// slice 2.6 Design question 7. Bucket 2's `FailExecAfterN(k)` is one-shot
// per container.Fake's slice-2.4 contract; with retry.Default.Attempts=3
// the (k+2)-th call would succeed and the "crash" would be invisible.
// Pinning attempts=1 makes the fault actually halt the step.

// propagationCaughtWorkflow exercises Bucket 4a sub-test "caught": step2 is
// wrapped in try.catch.finally; step2's command always exits 1 (with
// retry: { attempts: 1 } so the one-shot fake fault halts the step on the
// first call). The catch absorbs the failure, finally runs, step3 runs, the
// run completes ok.
